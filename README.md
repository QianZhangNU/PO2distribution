# PO2distribution
This is a program with GUI to generate PO2 distribution in the electrolyte for two-layer full cells and symmetric cells with YSZ as electrolyte in hydrogen enviroment or air enviroment.

Parameters:
Symmetric cell?: 0.0-->full cell, YSZ-GDC two-layer electrolyte
                 1.0-->symmetric cell in hydrogen, YSZ electrolyte
                 2.0-->symmetric cell in air, YSZ electrolyte
