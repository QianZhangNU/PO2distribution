This is a program with GUI to generate PO2 distribution in the electrolyte for two-layer full cells and symmetric cells with YSZ as electrolyte in hydrogen enviroment or air enviroment.

To use the code, you just run main.py with Python 3.+ and fill in the experimental data in the corresponding position as labels in the GUI.

Parameters:

Symmetric cell?: 

0.0 : full cell, YSZ-GDC two-layer electrolyte

1.0 : symmetric cell in hydrogen, YSZ electrolyte
                 
2.0 : symmetric cell in air, YSZ electrolyte
